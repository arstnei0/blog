# My personal website

This repo is deprecated! See my new website at [zihan-ch/portfolio](https://github.com/zihan-ch/portfolio)

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build). I chose [Solid](https://solidjs.com/) as the frontend framework.

The Chinese branch is [`cn`](https://github.com/zihan-ch/blog/tree/cn). 中文分支名为 [`cn`](https://github.com/zihan-ch/blog/tree/cn)。

# Dev

Use your favourite package manager(npm, yarn or pnpm). I use `pnpm`.

First, install the dependencies. For example:

```shell
pnpm i
```

Next, run the script `dev`. For example:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

or

```shell
npm run dev
```

The `build` script for building.

The site is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for the English site and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for the Chinese site. I use [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/) as my search engine(it's static).

The comment system is [Giscus](https://giscus.app).

All posts are in `src/pages/post/`. They are written in Markdown.

**Everything is made by myself**. I'm happy to see you here.

Bye.
