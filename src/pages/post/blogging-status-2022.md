Blogging is one of the happiest and the most encouraging thing in the world. For me.

Just a few days ago, I wrote an [article](https://zihan.ga/post/gitpod-is-in-big-trouble) about Gitpod and Github Codespaces, which is read by thousands of people.

The vercel usage showed me that it's read 9244 times.

While the Clarity(the analytics made by Microsoft) showed me that it's read by 1821 persons.(Some people who have install any kinds of AdBlock will not be counted)

It's really encouraging for me! Although I know that most of the visitors are just glancing, I'm still amazed by the influence of HN(I posted it on Hacker News).

Not all the responses are good. Some of the comments on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33569604) are aggresive(like "The article is trash."). I'm not surprised because I know that people who like to attack others will always leave a comment. And also, my article is not so good indeed. I wrote very quickly, without sufficient preparing and researching. My English is still developing, and my writting is not readable enough. I am always trying to improve it.(My mother tongue is not English) I'm also not experienced enough to have wide thoughts. I don't even know the differences between Slack and MS Teems! I still need to read more and think more. And also paraphrase my thoughts into clear points.

I really love blogging. Blogging is just like a record of the learning and growing timeline, which will not only influence the way you think, but also others' thoughts.

## About my site
Someone said the circle that follows the cursor on my personal website is annoying.

I removed that for now. If that WILL distract readers, I should remove it.

Also, I should review some of my UI designs now. Are they really convenient? If you have any good ideas about it, discuss it here.
