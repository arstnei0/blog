Every programmer uses [Github](https://github.com/). But not everyone knows how to use it properly. Today I will introduce some interesting usage of Github.

## Theme

Github has two themes: light and dark (I know, every website has). But do you know we can actually change it?

See [Github's appearance preference](https://github.com/settings/appearance) to change your theme.

You can even change the color of the button in Github! (You can only choose a preset that Github provides)

## Personal profile

Have you ever seen Github profiles like this?

Create a repo with a repo name which is exactly your Github username and add a README.md, you will see how it works.

To learn more about building a beautiful Github personal profile, just search it yourself. It's super easy to make one.

## Explore great projects

See [Explore Github](https://github.com/explore) to find interesting projects that Github believes you will love.

See [Trending repos on Github](https://github.com/trending) to find trending popular repos or developers. I'm pretty sure you will have fun there.

You can also [get email updates](https://github.com/explore/email) from Github.

I'm not advertising. It's really amazing!

## Github Pages

Github has written [an official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) to Github Pages. I think I don't need to repeat it.

## More

See [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/) to find deeper things about Github. Useful things always appear there.

## Anything else?
