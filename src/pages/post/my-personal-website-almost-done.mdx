# Foreword

Almost every single programmer has their own personal website and blog. I just heard [Astro](https://astro.build) and appreciate it a lot. I rewrote my blog from [Vue](https://vuejs.org) to Astro.(To tell you the truth, I have never finished my blogüëª)

Almost every single programmer will write one blog post about the tech stacks they used for their website, and then they will not write any more blog posts...ü§£ I read lots of blog posts from many peoples, and I know the big influence that a person's patience in writing blogs can be. Sometimes even though no one is reading your blog posts, but if you continue to blog, you will see how it can be one day. Therefore, I will stop writing a blog.

So, I announced, I start blogging today!

As you know, I am only 13 years old this year. This means I have many more time to blog than normal people. I am lucky.

Now, allow me to talk about the boring part - How I made this website. (No matter if you want to read, I will write thisüòù) I will try my best to take bunk away (I'm not sure if I can do that.üòÇ)

# How

I have said that I used [Astro](https://astro.build) to build this website. Astro is a modern framework for building faster websites. It's amazing! My first contribution to an open source project is just for [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build).

I deployed this site at [Vercel](https://vercel.com). I used to use [Couldflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), but once I tested the speed, I figured out that Vercel is much faster than Cloudflare Pages. Also, Vercel did really well with SSR. I was not using Vercel before just because of its 100-GB-bandwidth-one-month limitation. However, after I started using Astro, the bundle size will never be a problem. I switched to Vercel rapidly.

I'm using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as my frontend (also with [Astro Islands Architacture](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/)). But recently I'm thinking about switching to [Solid](https://solidjs.com). I like Solid more, but the bundle size of svelte is really attractive. However, when there are many components, the bundle size of svelte is no more as well as when there are only a few components. Solid's js performance is much better than svelte, and its bundle size is not really a problem.

Posts are written in Markdown. Of course it is. And the comment system is powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app). Giscus is easy to configure, but I still have an idea about building one comment system myself.

I registered the domain `zihan.ga` at [Freenom](https://freenom.com) and I'm now managing this domain with Cloudflare DNS. Undoubtably, Cloudflare is really good at DNS.

# Future goals

This website is not completed yet, and it will never be completed. Some new features will be added, or its theme may be changed with the trend of the time, and even its tech choices may be changed.

My current ideas about improving this website are listed below:

-   A right sidebar (or left) with table of all the headings of the article
-   Add a site search (probably provided by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/))
-   Change the framework from Svelte to Solid (it's not necessary, so it will probably be done later)
-   Improve the organization of CSS (it's really disorganized!)
-   Make the homepage more beautiful
-   Some style improvement (because I don't have much experience in designing)
-   Create a Chinese edition of this website (my mother tongue is actually Chinese)

I also need to make something to fill my [`projects` page](/projects).

# Conclusion

I'm sorry for all the bullshit above!üòï

I'm happy you've read so long!üòä
